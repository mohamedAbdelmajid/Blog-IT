                        I went out for a walk and was thinking about what I could write about myself. There are so many things that you can talk about yourself, but it’s best if you don’t have to say a single word and that a friend or a colleague talks good about you. But, they can’t know everything, and that’s the part that I will write about—the story about myself and why <a href="/">AnasKssama.com</a> was born.

                <h5>The falling letters</h5>
                <p className="lead">
                    The school prepared a test to check the skills of the students (including me). The teacher gave us instructions to sit in front of a monitor and a keyboard. On the monitor, letters will fall from the top, and we have to enter the letters one by one on the keyboard. If the letters fall on the ground, you lose points. Then the system will speed up, and in the end, you get your results. <br /> <br />

                    We had to press Enter to start the application. I didn’t know where the Enter button was. So I asked the teacher where I can find the Enter key. The answer was, it’s that big button on the right side of the keyboard. <br />

                    I did press the Enter button, and it started. The first letter started falling. I immediately started to find the letter on the keyboard. When the letter almost fell on the ground, I could see it on the keyboard and press it. The first couple of letters went well, but then I was too slow. I even placed my whole hand on the keyboard, thinking that it will work. Suddenly, I saw the FINISH message, and the application sent my score to the printer. <br /><br />

                    The teacher grabbed all the scores from the printer and placed them in a stack. The teacher started announcing the grades. The highest grade was grade ten, and the lowest was grade zero. Everyone was getting the grade six or higher. Some of them even had the grade nine or ten. My name came up, and what did I get? I did get a grade of zero. I told the teacher that I ticked a couple of letters on the keyboard. The reply was that it wasn’t even enough to score grade one. <br /> <br />

                    After the class finished, the teacher talked to me. Explaining that grade zero can’t be given, and that’s why he gave me a grade one. That’s the lowest grade that they can give. Next week the school will provide another test. If I can have a grade of ten, I would have an average of grade five and a half. That’s enough to pass.
